# Stats

This repository was created for Cranfield BIX Group Project, Group 2.
It contains the R script that performs Basic Stats analysis on the server. The code is run via command line.

The code goes through a fasta file and calculates assembly statistics which include total sequence length, longest and shortest length and GC content.
All values are rounded up to the next integer and exported as a text file, which is downloaded by the server on to the client application.
